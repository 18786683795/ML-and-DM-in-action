##Detail


###Learn-to-identify-similar-images

After reading some papers from internet,I implement three algorithms including Average Hash,
Discrete cosine transform and so on,which about how to identify the similar images,by Python
,Pillow and OpenCV.

I also complete a program to find the face from picture and identify the simliar face base on
the modal called Heer provided by OpenCV. 

This is another repository and you can find it  following this link.

I wrote a article about it to Segmentfault,but I wrote it in chinese.

###BetaMeow

I create BetaMeow,which can play **gobang game** with you 
after learning about the interesting match between AlphaGo and Lee se-dol. Comparing with the previous version,the current version has a great difference from the traditional gobang game AI. It makes a decision by Decision tree instead of search algorithms that the traditional
gobang game AI did.

BetaMeow can keep studying only if you provide data. Of course, thought it's not so perfect, I will do my best to update it.

####How To Begin

Download the code and enter following code when you are in the correct directory.

```
python ai.py
```
Open your browser and enter ```http://localhost/five``` then you can play with BetaMeow 

Please make sure that your**Port 80 is free**, otherwise you need to modify the code.


###Request

- python >= 3.4 
- flask 0.10.1

To Be Continue……


##Other

The reposiory record the code I write during I learning the machine learnning and data mining.
I won't provide a complete data file because they are generally too large to be stored.
But I will provide some important examples of data if necessary. 

**If you are interested in it.you can recommend your project about ML or DM and give me your URL.I will 
write the URL on my README file .At the same time I also hope you can write  URL of this reposiory
on  README file of your project.**

You can open a issue or Pull Request to me if you have a suggestion or better idea.

I will continue update the Repository for a long time,**welcome to watch it or 
give me a star for support**，thank you.
